            I developed an affinity for programming in secondary school(high school), while learning "BASIC" programming language as part of the curriculum.
            I then moved more towards web development as it connected with my aestetic and graphic design capabilities as well.
            After grauduating a computer college in 2014, i have also undergone high level training in "C", and mastered FrontEnd development languages.
            I gained problem solving skills in engineering college which has made me faster and more efficient in logical coding and JavaScript.
            This portfolio and every section of it was done using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. No bootstrap, Jquery or any framework.

                    I asked for a website for our music record label "Apartment 7", without much in mind to even think about while waiting, i was then wowed at how he considered 
                    both the artists and music as design, the manner of the design is one that gives me good hope for the record company of ours.
